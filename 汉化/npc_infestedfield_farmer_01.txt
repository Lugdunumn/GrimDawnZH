Oliver Thornsbury
I heard from Douglass that my farm has been cleared of the infestation. Don't suppose I have you to thank for that?
I found your wife's diary. It has some interesting stories in there.

Good luck out there.
I hope it's a good harvest.
Blasted Dermapterans. An entire year's worth of food is gonna go to waste out there.
Why hasn't the Black Legion cleared them out?
Hell if I know. Somer's only concerned with her war against the Aetherials. Then there's that blasted cult.{^n}{^n}I'm no soldier, so I suppose I'll just keep my mouth shut and work the fields we do have.
I see.

Oh, not again. Does she fly in this one? Her head is up in the clouds when we need it back down here.{^n}{^n}*Oliver sighs*{^n}{^n}Then again, we could all use a distraction these days. Maybe it will help her deal with all this tragedy.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
