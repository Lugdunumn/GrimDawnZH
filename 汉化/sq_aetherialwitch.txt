The Exile
The Aetherial Witch
Speak to Exile
Captain Reave of the Black Legion has determined that all of the Legion's recent troubles stem from the arrival of an aetherial witch in their midst. He is under strict orders not to harm Anasteria, but you are under no such obligation. Head into the Fort Ikon prison and deal with this traitorous wretch.


Speak to Anasteria at the Fort Ikon Prison







Kill Exile
You have spoken with Anasteria and agreed with Reave's assessment. Anasteria needs to die.


Slay Anasteria



Speak to Captain
You have slain the Aetherial witch Anasteria. Report back to Captain Reave at Fort Ikon of your success.
