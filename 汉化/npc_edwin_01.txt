Edwin
Where'd you find this guy? He'd make a soup out of stone if you asked him to, and I reckon it would still taste damn fine!
Rock soup, eh? Is it better than what you've been serving?
We got a joker in the midst now, eh?
I gotta go.
Sounds delicious.
I ain't gonna pretend that what I make is good, or even edible, but it fills up the gut and keeps us going. Can't do much without some proper equipment and supplies. If you ever want a bowl of the Edwin Special, you just let me know.
I'll, um, keep that in mind.
You must be the Taken the rumors been spreading about. Now I ain't gonna judge as I heard you've done right by us with that undead mess up in Lower Crossing. The name's Edwin and I do the cooking around here.
Pleased to meet you.
