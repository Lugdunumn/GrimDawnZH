The Black Legion cannot advance on the Necropolis directly, there are too many enemies and the losses would be too great. Instead, Creed has tasked you with sneaking in and securing a riftgate. Once you've done so, Ulgrim and a contingent of troops will join you for the final assault, where the enemy will least expect it.

The Black Legion cannot advance on the Necropolis directly, there are too many enemies and the losses would be too great. Instead, Creed has tasked you with sneaking in and securing a riftgate deep inside the Necropolis. Once you've done so, Ulgrim and a contingent of troops will join you for the final assault, where the enemy will least expect it.
