See something you like?{^n}{^n}Move along.
Alright then.
Hate to admit, for a while there I thought I was as good as dead.{^n}{^n}Thank you, for my freedom.
How did Nathaniel get the best of you?
They must have seen me working the cauldron, saw some Aether glow and jumped to their own crazy conclusions. They were on me before I could cast a single spell.{^n}{^n}I may have access to powers beyond most men, but I am no Aetherial.{^n}{^n}Here, take this. It is a paltry gift, but the least I could offer my savior. I will not forget this kindness. Farewell.
Goodbye.
Earlier, you stared at me as if you knew everything about me.
A little trick I picked up. You should work on that, blocking your thoughts. Not all mind readers are as benevolent as I am.{^n}{^n}Nevertheless, you are not Taken either, though the after-effects on your mind are astonishing. It's as if the Aetherial was rearranging your brain.
Rearranging how?
Hard to say. Perhaps you should ask the one that did this to you?{^n}{^n}*Rallia laughs*


See something you like?{^n}{^n}Move along.
Alright then.
