Father Kymon has a special task he has entrusted only to you. Within the Asterkarn Mountain, north of Darkvale, there is a tomb which houses a powerful relic known as the Eye of Korvaak. Father Kymon wishes you to recover the relic as it will please Empyrion. The Eye is said to be a lens into a man's soul, allowing Kymon to peer into the hearts of his followers and tell the truly devout apart from the false. The Eye is hidden from mortal hands behind a false wall. Look for a torch that has lost its flame. Should you recover the Eye, Kymon will entrust you with his innermost secrets and allow you to enter his study.
