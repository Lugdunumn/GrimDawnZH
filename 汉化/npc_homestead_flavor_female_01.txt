Daila Thornsbury
I've been, um, writing again.{^n}{^n}*Daila blushes*{^n}{^n}I hope you don't mind, but I wrote you into the story.
Sure, but I better not die at the end.
Just make sure my character's really buff.
I really don't want to know.
Thank you for returning my diary to me.{^n}{^n}It might seem silly, but writing helps me relax; even now, with the world as it is.
Farewell.
Thank you for clearing out our farm. It's the best news I've heard in weeks.
I found your diary.
Oh heavens, I hope you didn't read it. It's not proper to stick your nose into a lady's private scribblings.{^n}{^n}Thank you, I dropped it when we fled the farm. Figured the Dermapterans would have shredded it by now.
I assure you, I have not read a word. (Lie)
Your secret is safe with me. (Wink)
You're welcome.
Please, make yourself at home.

Oh, hello there. You startled me.{^n}{^n}I'm probably not the person you're looking for. You should speak to Douglass if you require assistance.

Welcome back. It's always a pleasure.
Likewise.
