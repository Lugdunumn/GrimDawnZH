Jagged Waste
Ol' Bloodbriar
Kill Beast
You have proven yourself to be a capable hunter by acquiring the manticore venom, so Kadris has entrusted you with a hunt he has personally been struggling to track down out in the wilderness. Local stories speak fearfully of an ancient thorner horror known as Ol' Bloodbriar. As it turns out, some of the stories are true and Ol' Bloodbriar's been reported terrorizing the farmers in Homestead. Deathmark Kadris has tracked it as far as the Shaded Basin, to the south of his camp in the Pine Barrens, but is unsure as to where its lair is. If you hunt down the beast, Kadris will see that his superiors are aware of your contributions and will throw a few coins into the mix as a bounty.
