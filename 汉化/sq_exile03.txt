Anasteria is interested in lost artifacts, particularly from the Arkovian era. She has implored you to enter the Steps of Torment in the Broken Hills, the section beyond the sealed ancient gates, and banish the skeletal fiend known as the Shade of Elnadrin. Take its tome, known as the Archive of Fates Untold, and bring it to Anasteria at the Fort Ikon Prison.
