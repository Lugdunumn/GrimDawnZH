Brother Molltair
You have chosen wisely, friend. May Empyrion bless your path.
Where is the Kymon's Chosen sanctuary?
Out beyond Blood Grove. We have taken refuge within an old fort known as Sorrow's Bastion. Follow the road north.
Thank you.
Farewell.
You do not belong here. Leave at once and you may still live.
Alright, I'm going.
You have chosen wisely, friend. May Empyrion bless your path.
Farewell.
Only those who seek Empyrion's truth are welcome here. You should leave.
Farewell.
You are expected at our Enclave.
Where is your enclave located?
Head out through the northern gates and into the Blood Grove. Follow the road until you reach old fortress ruins. That's Sorrow's Bastion. Our enclave is in the tower.
Thank you.
I'm on my way.
I must ask that you visit our enclave to the north. We have taken over a part of Sorrow's Bastion and made it our new home.{^n}{^n}Seek us out by taking the road north through the Blood Grove. When you've reached the ruins, look for the tower.{^n}{^n}Once there, please speak to Brother Elluvius. He will set you upon our enlightened path.
I will seek out your enclave.
Perhaps another time.
Only those who seek Empyrion's truth are welcome here. You should leave.
Farewell.
