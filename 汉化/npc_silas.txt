Silas
I'm goin', I'm goin'. Got money to spend anyhow.
Good.
What ya comin' near me fer? Git back to work.
I'm going.
Back to work with ya. Quota's goin' up next week, ya know.
I think I'm going to kill you this time.
Ya watch yer litte mouth or I'll have to carve ya another.
You die today. (Attack)
Nevermind.
Whatever you say.
Back to work with ya. Quota's goin' up next week, ya know.
Whatever you say.
What ya comin' near me fer? Git back to work.
What are you doing here?
New to the village, eh? See, this place here's under our protection. Mind yer own business and scram.
Extortion? Men like you deserve to die.
A man might take that as a threat. Ya ain' threatenin' me, are ya?


Perhaps I am. (Attack)
Nevermind.

I've got the scrap.
What ya waitin' for then. Give it here.
Will this suffice?
Good, good. Now back to work with ya.
Whatever.
On second thought, I think I'd rather kill you.
Oy, this one's got a spine. Gonna give ya a few seconds to change yer mind before I pound yer face into the sand.
Fine, take the scrap and choke on it.

No, I'm sure. You die. (Attack)
Nevermind.
How much coin would it take to make you leave?
Now yer talking my language. Look, I don' much care for this joint and a bit o' coin sure might raise a man's reputation up above, see? Gimme 2500 Iron Bits and I'll tell Darius this place ain' worth the trouble no more.
Just take the scrap.
Deal. (Give 2500 Iron Bits)
Good, good. Glad to be done with this slith hole. Now git out of my sight 'fore I change my mind.
You better be gone when I return.
Whatever you say.
On second thought, I think I'd rather kill you.
Oy, this one's got a spine. Gonna give ya a few seconds to change yer mind before I pound yer face into the sand.

No, I'm sure. You die. (Attack)
Nevermind.
Nevermind.
I think you should leave before someone gets hurt.

No more scrap. You die today.
Oy, this one's got a spine. Gonna give ya a few seconds to change yer mind before I pound yer face into the sand.

No, I'm sure. You die. (Attack)
Nevermind.
Forget it.
What ya comin' near me fer? Git back to work.
What's going on here?
New to the village, eh? See, this place here's under our protection. Mind yer own business and scram.
Nevermind.
I'm going.
