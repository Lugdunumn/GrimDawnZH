Kalista
Hush now, little human. We wouldn't want to spoil the fun for the others. Now would we?
You monster.
Please, I'm so scared.
Someone is coming. Just hang in there.
Please help me. I'm so scared.
How did you get trapped down here?
I was out playing by myself like mama said not to. I wandered into this cave when the exit collapsed behind me.{^n}{^n}*Kalista sobs between words*{^n}{^n}Please, I just want to go home to my mama and papa. They live in a camp nearby.
Of course I will help you out. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be right back.
Why didn't they come looking for you?
I...I don't know. Why does it matter? Maybe they couldn't find this place under all the rocks.{^n}{^n}*Kalista is ready to cry*{^n}{^n}You're frightening me with all your questions. I just need to get out of this prison!
Ok, calm down. I will get you home. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be right back.


Where is your camp?
You must have passed the camp on the way here. I sense... I mean, I know my people are down below in the valley; probably waiting for me!{^n}{^n}*Kalista sobs*{^n}{^n}Please, you must let me out; I must escape this place!
I will get you home. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be right back.
Why didn't your parents look for you?

How long have you been down here?
I...I don't know. Many days.{^n}{^n}It's dark and scary here. And...and sometimes I hear things crawling around but I can't see them.{^n}{^n}I'd really like to go home now. I'm hungry; so hungry...
I will get you home. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be right back.
Shouldn't someone be out looking for you?


I find it odd that you survived on your own out here.
I find it odd that you're so suspicious. Your mistrust must be a reflection of your own poor character!{^n}{^n}Is your heart so bitter that you won't help a lost child find their way home?{^n}{^n}Please help me!
I will get you home. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be right back.
Why hasn't someone come looking for you?



Where are you from?
I live in a nearby camp with mama and papa. They say we are...Row...Rovers, but I don't know what that means.{^n}{^n}I just wanna go home.
I will get you home. (Open Riftgate)
I'll be right back.

Something seems off here.
*Flame flickers in Kalista's eyes*{^n}{^n}Take me from this place now!
You are a deceiver, demon. (Attack)
I will spare you, for now.
How long have you been down here?
I...I don't know. Many days.{^n}{^n}It's dark and scary here. And...and sometimes I hear things crawling around but I can't see them.{^n}{^n}I'd really like to go home now.

A little girl all by herself in here?
*Kalista suddenly looks serious*{^n}{^n}I'm not a little girl. I'm almost this many years old.{^n}{^n}*Kalista holds up a hand with all her fingers spread out*{^n}{^n}Mama says so.
