Destroy Wagons
It appears that the ritual is being powered by blood harvested at the cult's camps, delivered to the Necropolis in Blood Wagons. You will not be able to enter the Loghorrean's tomb without destroying the source of the precious fluid. There are three Blood Wagons you will have to deal with before the cultist sigil will weaken enough for you to pass through.

Destroy the northern Blood Wagon
Destroy the eastern Blood Wagon
Destroy the western Blood Wagon

Kill Final Boss
You have destroyed the Blood Wagons and the way to the Tomb of the Watchers is clear. Enter the tomb and seek out the Ulgrim at the bottom level, at the Seal of the Loghorrean. Together, you must stop the cult's ritual for good.






Stop the summoning of the Loghorrean

Return to Creed
You have banished the mythical beast known as the Loghorrean back into the void pit from which it spawned, but at a high price.{^n}{^n}Return to Inquisitor Creed at Fort Ikon with the news.
