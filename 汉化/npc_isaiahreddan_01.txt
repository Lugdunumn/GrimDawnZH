Isaiah Reddan
Just leave me alone. You got your money.
Bye.
Hello again, stranger. Still in these parts, I see.
Goodbye.
Move along, stranger.
Bye.
Who in hell are you? What do you want from me?
Are you Isaiah? I'm here about your partner.
That swine isn't dead yet? Let me explain. This is a huge misunderstanding!
Say what you have to say, but make it quick.
Drew is a worthless scum. This mess wasn't about the haul of scrap. That bastard tried to rape my daughter, Josephine, when we were last camped out. I confronted him and he got violent. Rotting out there along the road is the least he deserved for trying to overpower a young girl.
I'm sorry I rushed to judgement. Be more careful in the future.
You can count on that. Travel safe, stranger.
Farewell.
Just give me Drew's share of the loot and I'll leave you be.

Sorry, this all sounds too convenient. Prepare to eat cold steel.

I don't really care. Give me half the profits and I'll leave this be.
Extortion then? Fine, take the money and choke on it.
That will suffice.
Save it. Prepare to face justice!
I'm not just going to lay down and die! I don't normally resort to this, but if you're in league with Drew, then so be it.
Time to die!
Move along, stranger.
Bye.
