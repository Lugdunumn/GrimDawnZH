Torven
Return to this refuge again if you need respite from your journey.
Thank you.
Greetings. I'm afraid I have little to offer you but a place to rest beside the fire.
Thank you.
Ah, so you've returned. Do you have the necklaces?
Will these suffice?
Ah yes, there is raw power in these bones and my deft old hands will weave it into something more potent yet. I will have the finished ring for you shortly.
Thank you.
Our paths converge again.
Farewell.
You travel a dangerous path stranger. This solitary refuge is one of the few safe places left in the Wightmire. If you plan to set out on the road again, perhaps there is a way that we could help one another.
And what might that be?
The Slith are unnatural creatures and poison the land itself; so it seems only fitting that we should turn some of their vile magic against them. Their shamans carry bone necklaces, primitive things, but they carry primal power within them. I can weave this power into something more potent for you.{^n}{^n}If you bring me a few of their necklaces, and say 100 iron bits to aid us in return, I will fashion for you a magical ring. What say you?
You have a deal.
Not interested.
Will these necklaces suffice?

No thank you.
