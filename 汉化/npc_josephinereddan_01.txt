You! You are the murderer who killed my father!
Excuse me? You must be confusing me with someone else.
I saw you while you threatened my father and murdered him in cold blood. What did we ever do to you?!
Your father murdered his partner for a pile of scrap. It was justice.
You fool! Drew tried to rape me in my sleep and my father defended me from him. That slimy slith continues to hurt us even in death.{^n}{^n}You will die for this!
Killing me won't bring him back.
No, but at least it will give me closure. Now shut up and die!
So be it.
You don't stand a chance.
Maybe I am. What will you do about it?
I'm going to kill his murderer! Draw your weapon, you heartless bastard!
So be it.
Move along, I'm not here for you.
Um, alright.
