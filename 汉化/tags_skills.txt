tagSkillClassDescription01=Soldiers of the imperial army were trained to survive in the{^n}most hellish conditions and hold the line against the deadliest{^n}enemies of the empire. Soldiers prefer the use of close combat{^n}weaponry, such as a sword and shield, but can also prove{^n}formidable with firearms. What a Soldier may lack in outright{^n}damage output is made up for in fortitude and leadership.

tagSkillClassDescription02=Pyrotechnic masters of the imperial army; Demolitionists are{^n}part engineer; part sorcerer. They were used to break enemy{^n}ranks and breach fortifications with their devastating array{^n}of explosives and destructive magic.

tagSkillClassDescription03=Once hunted by imperial forces in an effort to control eldritch{^n}power, the Occultist's craft focuses heavily on summoning and{^n}borrowed powers granted by the three witch "gods" Bysmiel,{^n}Solael and Dreeg. Their diverse arts include abhorrent curses{^n}and spells that inflict damage with poison, acid, and entropic{^n}energy. Excelling with neither sword nor gun, they can use{^n}either to augment their offense.

tagSkillClassDescription05=对于秘术师来说，魔法的显现根本就是不是什么秘密，也不是什么神的旨意，而是一门需要研究的学问。这种对知识的渴求让所有秘术师都渴望发明新法术，然后用自己的名字为之命名。秘术师随意糅合虚灵和各种元素的能量，创造出了许多能毁灭一支小型军队的法术。不过，使用了如此强大的力量，防守起来自是力不从心。
