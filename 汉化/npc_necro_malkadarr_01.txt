Malkadarr
So, it is you I must thank for my resurrection?
I have some questions.
Speak.
Are you immortal?
For as long as the ashes burn within me or the Keeper deems it necessary.
I have another question.
Goodbye.
So what happens now?
That is for the Keeper to decide. I am hers to command.
Are you her slave?
A strong way to put it, but in a sense.{^n}{^n}Whatever the Keeper wishes shall be done.
Why would you agree to this?
To gain access to the innermost secrets of Necromancy, I had to agree to this binding, so that all I learn is not lost should I perish.{^n}{^n}It was a price worth paying; an honor, not a curse.
Will you obey me?
*Malkadarr cackles*{^n}{^n}You may have participated in my return, but you are not the one who performed the binding.
I have another question.
I see.
I have another question.
A steep price for knowledge.
I have another question.
Sounds like a terrible fate.
I have another question.
I shall speak to her then.
What's it like, being undead?
A strange question. What does it feel like to be alive?{^n}{^n}I feel no pain. I feel no hunger. I will never tire. Mortal limitations no longer concern me.
I have another question.
Goodbye.
Nevermind.
Welcome back, Malkadarr.
By the will of the Keeper, I have returned.
Who are you?
I am Malkadarr, first circle of the Order.{^n}{^n}I was dead, but no longer. The Keeper saw it fit to return me into the Order's service.
A resurrection? Impressive.
A resurrection? That's unsettling.
