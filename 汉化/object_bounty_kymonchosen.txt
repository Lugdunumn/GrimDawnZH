The Order of Death's Vigil goes too far in their pursuit of sacrilegious magic.

Legends say that ghouls were once humans. Humans twisted by madness and obsessed with devouring dead flesh.{^n}{^n}Now they are little more than mindless fiends, abominations that deserve no pity or remorse. 古代墓地 is teeming with these Corpse-eaters. If Cairn is to be cleansed, then they must be eradicated.{^n}{^n}Any such effort shall be rewarded with iron bits.

Reports have come in from the frontlines that a necromancer scum by the name Ravok has been desecrating our dead and using them to bolster her reinforcements.{^n}{^n}This is a despicable display of indecency in war and a complete lack of respect to the fallen. The Chosen will not stand idly by as our dead are desecrated before our eyes. This Master Ravok is to be made an example of.{^n}{^n}Anyone willing to take on this critical task will be rewarded with materials from our stores.

The Cult of Ch'thon has twisted many individuals under their bloodstained banner. Their promises of a Cairn restored resonate with many, from the lowest beggar to the most esteemed of nobles.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon once knew a man named Salazar from the high court in Erulan. This same man turned out to be a traitor to humanity as he now serves the Dead God in the 伯尔维治 Outskirts.

Cleansed by fire, the Chosen march onto battlefields unknown. Such is our destiny and our charge.{^n}{^n}In the 血森林, through a rift torn between our world and theirs, there is a plane of existence we call the Ashen Waste. There dwells a cruel creature by the name 沃姆·祖尔. It is a beast of fire and brimstone, a mockery of the cleansing flame of Empyrion. By Kymon's Will, it is to be destroyed.{^n}{^n}Anyone willing to take on this critical task will be rewarded with materials from our stores.

The accursed Ch'thon has many loyal followers, but none as reviled as his Chosen. The Chosen of Ch'thon willingly give their bodies to the void, allowing its most powerful fiends to cross over into Cairn without the use of a riftgate.{^n}{^n}One such Chosen, by the name Thullon, has been spotted making the rounds at Cult's camps. This is an opportunity, brothers and sisters. One that we cannot miss.{^n}{^n}Thullon's elimination will be amply rewarded with materials from our stores.

Ghouls, despicable beings and abominations. The weak ones hide in the shadows, skulking about tombs searching for their next meal.{^n}{^n}But it is the greater ghouls that should strike terror into the hearts of man. They do not fear the sun, do not fear flame. They are the nightmares with which we must contend.{^n}{^n}One such ghoul, we call it Abathis, has been wandering 古代墓地. For the sake of Cairn herself, it must be slain.{^n}{^n}Abathis' elimination will be amply rewarded with materials from our stores.

Though our battle is with the Order and the Cult of Ch'thon, we must never forget that another enemy seeks to usurp this world from the dominance of man.{^n}{^n}The Aetherials warp flesh to their whims, turning beast and man alike into abominations. One such creation has been spotted in the Gruesome Harvest. This Amalgamation they are creating is an insult to the gods and must be destroyed.{^n}{^n}Anyone willing to take on this monstrosity will be justly rewarded with a substantial sum of iron bits.

The Bastion of Chaos is one of the largest rifts we've ever seen. Every day, it spits out countless demons into our world. But the true terrors dwell within.{^n}{^n}Obsidian Annihilators are the harbingers of our world's destruction. One such creature once felled a dozen loyal Chosen. The Bastion is where these monsters are birthed, and where they must be destroyed.{^n}{^n}Anyone daring enough to enter the Bastion will be justly rewarded with a substantial sum of iron bits. Tavel with Kymon's blessing, brave Chosen.
