Rhowari Legacy
Repair Shrine
Far to the north, in the Asterkarn Mountains, the Cult of Ch'thon has desecrated the Shrine of Mogdrogen, a place sacred to the Rovers. Amkala has asked you to recover the parts of the shrine that had been stolen by the cultists and to restore the shrine by returning the pieces, along with an Ancient Heart, to the Shrine. The pieces are lost to the void, through rifts open in the Blood Grove, to the north of Homestead, and the Plains of Strife, north of Fort Ikon.
