Reanimators are the harbingers of the Aetherial invasion. They supply the enemy with reinforcements and spread corruption with every step.{^n}{^n}If you thin their numbers, then that should give the guards of Devil's Crossing a much needed reprieve.{^n}{^n}You will be suitably rewarded with iron bits.

Darius Cronley's closest lieutenants are some of the most vicious and deadly men that escaped the prison after the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}For now they seem content to remain in the Four Hills in Old Arkovia, but should they ever lead an attack on Devil's Crossing, the casualties would be severe.{^n}{^n}This threat must be dealt with directly. A stash of iron bits awaits anyone that claims their lives.

Cronley's recruited all manner of cruel and despicable men to his cause, not the least of which is a bastard known as "The Bruiser" Romanov.{^n}{^n}Romanov takes savage pleasure in smashing in people's skulls whenever they displease him. Cronley seems to encourage the behavior. To make matters worse, Romanov now appears to be a part of Cronley's inner circle, tainted with Aether crystals that grant him inhuman strength.He is rarely seen away from his boss in the mines below the Four Hills in Old Arkovia. Devil's Crossing has prepared a hefty sum of iron bits to see Romanov put to justice.

For the first time since evading capture back before the Grim Dawn, Bolla "The Raven" has been spotted out in the Arkovian Foothills.

The slith are notorious for poisoning water supplies with the venomous excretions of their matriarchs.{^n}{^n}One such matriarch, Slathra the Plagued, has been spotted around a cavern in the Foggy Bank.{^n}{^n}It is imperative that she is slain before she has a chance to befoul what little fresh water we have left.{^n}{^n}The prison is short on supplies, but we will set aside some materials for anyone that deals with this threat.

Ballior was once a joyful older man who managed a bakery in Burrwitch. Sadly, he fell when the Aetherials attacked.{^n}{^n}I dread to think of what the Aetherials had done to his remains when they dragged him into a cellar. It would ease my heart to know that he is at peace.{^n}{^n}I do not have much to offer, but I've set aside some materials for anyone that puts Ballior to rest.

Romanov was a brutal man with more muscle than brains back before the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}Now rumor is that he's accepted Cronley's Aether crystals to become even stronger. If such a beast of a man ever decides to attack Devil's Crossing, he could cause some serious harm.{^n}{^n}Anyone that tracks down Romanov and puts him down will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.

It was no secret that Caspis was a blood-drinker and devout of Ch'thon. What is unfortunate is that he survived the Grim Dawn.{^n}{^n}Reports have come in of Caspis capturing travelers out in the Burrwitch Outskirts. It's unlikely that he's working alone, so there has to be a gathering of cultists somewhere in the area.{^n}{^n}Anyone that tracks down Caspis to his hideout and puts him down will be justly rewarded with some of our scavenged materials.

One of Cronley's closest lackeys has been spotted out in the Four Hills.

The outlaws inhabiting the Four Hills in Old Arkovia have a favorite past-time: throwing unarmed prisoners into their pit to face off against Boris.{^n}{^n}Boris is a butcher who revels in the bloodshed. It's sickening.{^n}{^n}Whenever he's about the Four Hills, he can be found in the pit near the coast. Putting him down within his own arena would be a poetic end to the maniac.{^n}{^n}To see this through, Devil's Crossing has prepared a hefty sum of iron bits as compensation for the death of Boris.
