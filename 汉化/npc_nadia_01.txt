What? Another survivor?{^n}{^n}Welcome to hell. We're trapped out here, cut off by the Aetherials.
Calm down, I've been looking for you.
Looking for us? {^n}{^n}I wouldn't have thought they'd risk sending someone else to check on us.
Captain Wilfor sent me.
Bless the captain. He wasn't sure we could do this, and he was right.{^n}{^n}There were others, another scavenge team. Have you seen them?
They're safe, now you need to get out of here.
That's good news.{^n}{^n}After we split up, I couldn't find them again. I assumed they were dead.{^n}{^n}Whatever you need to do to get us out of here, I'm ready.
Ok, here you go. (Open Riftgate)
I'll find them, but you need to get out of here first.
Whatever you need to do, I'm ready.{^n}{^n}Anything to be out of here.
Here you go. (Open Riftgate)
Hold on a moment.
What? Another survivor?{^n}{^n}Welcome to hell. We're trapped out here, cut off by the Aetherials.
I'll send someone to help you.
