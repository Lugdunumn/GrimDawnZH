Thank you...you've done us all... a great service.
Glad I could help.
Forgive me, but I must rest.
Very well.
Does the beast... still live?
Where should I be looking?
Gulgoth, the Rampaging... was last seen beyond the barricade... down the road.
I will slay it.
Yes, I'm still searching.
Stranger, you... you look well armed and capable. I've been... injured by a rogue troll that's rampaging around these parts. Please... find... the beast and slay it. It's a... danger to our camp and to all travelers. Look... for it... beyond the barricade... down the road...
I will end the beast's life.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
