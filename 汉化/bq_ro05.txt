There, an ancient Arkovian spirit known as Baron Wradlith has dominated over the other spirits, rallying them under his command.{^n}{^n}For now, the spirits remain within the caves, but the undead can be unpredictable. This Lord of the Lost Souls must be banished before he even considers leaving his underground kingdom.{^n}{^n}We will happily share their scavenged materials with anyone that braves the Spined Cove.
