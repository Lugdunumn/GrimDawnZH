Kymon's Chosen
The Prophet's Call
Find Kymon
Brother Mollarg, a representative of Kymon's Chosen, has asked you to travel north to Sorrow's Bastion, where the Chosen have their enclave. To reach the fort, follow the road north out of Homestead, through the Blood Grove. When you've reached the ruins, look for the tower. Once inside, speak to Brother Elluvius.
