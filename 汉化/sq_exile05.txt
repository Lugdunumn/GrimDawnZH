The Outcast's Revenge
Aetherial Boss Item
阿纳斯塔里娅's divination has revealed to you the name and location of one of the major players in the Aetherial invasion. You must enter the AREA, north of Burrwitch, and open the sealed gates. Once inside, track down Archivist Thelon and slay him. Bring his intact head to 阿纳斯塔里娅 at the Fort Ikon Prison so that she may...study it.
