Kymon's Chosen
Making a Stand
Kill Cultist Champions
The Cult of Ch'thon has been expanding its reach and their activities in Darkvale have been tolerated for too long. Two of the cult's more prominent members, Bolvar the Bloodbinder and Zaria the Carver have been spotted near Darkvale. Father Kymon wishes them eliminated, as the vermin they are. End their lives for the good of us all.
Kill Bolvar, the Bloodbinder
Kill Zaria, the Carver

Return to Zealots
You have slain the heretics and the Cult has lost two prominent members. Report back to Brother Elluvius at Sorrow's Bastion.
