Alright.
You took my smithing hammer and left me for dead.{^n}{^n}We have nothing to say to each other.
I...alright.
You again. You already forced me to give up my hammer, is there something else left which you want to take?{^n}{^n}We have nothing to say to each other.
Alright.
Ah, it's you again.{^n}{^n}I trust that my apprentice is making good use of the Malleum Menhir?
How did you make it out here?
Well, I traveled north through the wilderness, careful to avoid any settlements that might attract Aetherial attention.{^n}{^n}Eventually stumbled upon a Legion camp, enlisted on the spot. We were recalled back to Fort Ikon several days later.{^n}{^n}Had a few close calls along the way, but here we are.
Glad you made it.
How are you faring without the hammer?
It is a shame that my finest work is behind me, but I can still procure fine armor and weapons for these brave men and women.{^n}{^n}I do the best I can with what I've got.
Take care.
Yes, his work is helping out the people of Devil's Crossing.
I have to go.
If you need something, speak Captain Reave.
Alright.
