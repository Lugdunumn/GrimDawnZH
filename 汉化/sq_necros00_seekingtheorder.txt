Seeking the Order
Find Order
Haruuv, a representative of the Order of Death's Vigil, has asked you to travel to a crypt near Sorrow's Bastion, where the Order has its sanctum. To reach the crypt, follow the road north out of Homestead, through the Blood Grove. When you've reached the ruins of Sorrow's Bastion, look west for the crypt entrance. Once inside, speak to Master Varuuk.
