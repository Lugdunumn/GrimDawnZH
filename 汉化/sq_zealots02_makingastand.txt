Kymon's Chosen
Making a Stand
Kill Cultist Champions
The Cult of Ch'thon has been expanding its reach and their activities in Darkvale have been tolerated for too long. One of the cult's more prominent members, Bolvar the Bloodbinder has been spotted to the north, in 血森林. Father Kymon wishes him eliminated as the vermin he is. End his life for the good of us all.
Kill Bolvar, the Bloodbinder

Return to Zealots
You have slain the heretic and the Cult has lost a prominent member. Report back to Brother Elluvius at 悲伤城堡.
