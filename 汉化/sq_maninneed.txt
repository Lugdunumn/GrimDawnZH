Broken Hills
A Man in Need
Get dynamite
You encountered a lone traveler, Myles Finegan, outside of a collapsed cave entrance in the Broken Hills, near the Tower of Exile. As this was his only safe haven, he implored you to help him acquire some dynamite from the bandits camped out in Old Arkovia so that he can clear the way into his hideout and retrieve his belongings.

Kill Myles
Myles has betrayed you. He is in fact a devout of Ch'thon and his cave is a sanctuary for his despicable acts. It was all a ruse to lure you in. Slay Myles within the Forsaken Den in the Broken Hills.
