Haruuv
The path you walk is a wise one. We look forward to working alongside you.
Likewise.
If your decision-making is indicative of the Black Legion, then perhaps humanity is doomed after all.
I do what I must so that we all survive.
I sincerely hope that you are right then. But I can't help but question your allegiance with fanatics.
Goodbye.
I did what I feel is right.
The one you call Ulgrim has asked to speak with the Order of Death's Vigil, so I have come before you.

Goodbye.

I think I've made my decision.
What will it be then? Will the Black Legion fight alongside the Order of Death's Vigil against these invaders to our realm?
The Black Legion will work with you. (Select the Order)
Splendid. I shall make the arrangements immediately.


Actually, I'll need more time to think this through.
What can you tell me about the Order?


What can you tell me about Uroboruuk?




I'll need some time to think this through.
What is necromancy?




I'll need some time to think this through.

What can you tell me about Kymon's Chosen?



I'll need some time to think this through.
