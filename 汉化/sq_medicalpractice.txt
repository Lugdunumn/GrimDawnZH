Eva of the Rovers desperately needs supplies to treat her wounded brethren. If you were to acquire some Royal Jelly from the Wasp Hives in Old Arkovia, she would be eternally grateful. She promised to teach you some of her people's medical secrets in return. There are two Wasp Hives in Old Arkovia, one just off the Rocky Coast and the other south of Twin Falls.
