Scoutmaster Lysell
I won't forget what you've done. It may be sentimental, but those brave men and women deserved this small respect.
Goodbye.
As you were.
Goodbye.
Any luck recovering those insignias?
Yes. Here they are.
Thank you. It may seem like a small gesture to you, but you've helped honor the Legion's fallen, and we do not forget that.{^n}{^n}Please, take these iron bits as compensation. It is the least we can do in return.
Thank you.
Any luck recovering those insignias?
Where should I be looking?
Head out into cultist territory, to the north of Homestead.{^n}{^n}I'm not holding out any hope that my men survived out there, so just bring back their insignias.
I will head out there at once.
I'm still searching.
I hear you're going to attack the cultist camps. Ballsy move. But after what you did to that Aetherial abomination, I suppose you're capable of anything.{^n}{^n}Since you're already planning to stick your neck out for us, I was wondering if you could do the Legion a small service.
What do you need?
At Captain Somer's command, I've been sending out scouting parties to the north in order to study the cultist operations there. The cult has a strong presence and they've been bringing powerful chthonic monstrosities into the world. Needless to say, it's dangerous work. Many of my men have not returned.{^n}{^n}When a soldier falls in battle and we can't recover the body, we make sure to at least bring back their insignia so that they can receive a humble send-off to whatever hell awaits us all. My scouts deserve more, but right now I can't even give them that.{^n}{^n}We've lost too many men out there as it is. I can't spare anyone else to recover those insignias. Will you pay my men this last respect? I'll be sure to make it worth your while.
I will honor your dead.
I'm sorry, I cannot do this right now.
I already found some insignias. Here you go.
Thank you. It may seem like a small gesture to you, but you've helped honor the Legion's fallen, and we do not forget that.{^n}{^n}Please, take these iron bits as compensation. It is the least we can do in return.
Thank you.
What can you tell me about the area?
Well, I'd best describe it as somewhere between in trouble and royally screwed. We have Aetherials to the south and west. You've done a number on their farm though, so we probably don't have to worry about them as much anymore. Not for a while at least.{^n}{^n}The cultists are assaulting us from the north. They've been capturing any stragglers and bringing them to their blood farms to harvest for some chthonic rituals. Those are the lucky ones. The others get strung up like scarecrows for the birds to have their feast.Finally, we have the Dermapteran infestation to the west. So long as they stay to the fields, we don't want anything to do with them. We're spread thin as it is.
Did you say you needed help?
Thanks.
Scoutmaster Lysell, at your service.
What can you tell me about the area?
Well, I'd best describe it as somewhere between in trouble and royally screwed. We have Aetherials to the south and west, working on some deplorable creations in those abandonded farms, I'm sure.{^n}{^n}The cultists are assaulting us from the north.
