Dean Oldbarrow
Looks like the old man was right to trust you. We owe you our thanks.
Just doing my part.
What brings you to Homestead?
What can you tell me about Homestead?
Not much to tell. When the attacks started, we gathered our neighbors and holed up in here as best we could.{^n}{^n}Things were looking pretty bad up until the Legion showed up. Now we stand a fighting chance.
Farewell.
Just passing through.
