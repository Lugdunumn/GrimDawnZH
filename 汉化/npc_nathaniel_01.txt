Good riddance to Taken. Got another one strung up and ready to burn.
Not getting involved.
The only good Taken is a fried Taken.{^n}{^n}One less Aetherial to worry about.
Goodbye.
Ah, look at her fry. It's inspiring, fighting back against the enemy.
It was just one Aetherial.
That may be so, but that's one less of them slithering about us regular people.{^n}{^n}Help yourself to some of her spoils. She was carrying a gemmed dagger. May be worth a few iron bits.
Thanks.
Well, what are ya waiting for? The Taken needs to burn.
I'm not convinced she's Taken.
What do ya mean? Just look at her, Aetherial if I ever saw one.{^n}{^n}We saw her casting wicked Aetherial magic. There's no doubt.
There's no proof.
Ah, I see it now.{^n}{^n}She's bewitched ya with her powers. Yer just as good as a Taken.{^n}{^n}Boys, looks like we've got ourselves another one.
What? No, I...forget it. (Attack)
Nevermind, let her burn. (Burn Rallia)
I need time to think.
Leave this woman alone.
Are ya threatening me? Ya ain't on the Taken's side, are ya?
Step away from her.
Ah, I see it now.{^n}{^n}She's bewitched ya with her powers. Yer just as good as a Taken.{^n}{^n}Boys, looks like we've got ourselves another one.
What? No, I...forget it. (Attack)
Nevermind, let her burn. (Burn Rallia)
I need time to think.
Nevermind, let her burn. (Burn Rallia)
You're a murderer, time to die. (Attack)
I need a minute.
Well, what are ya waiting for? The Taken needs to burn.
I need to discuss this with my allies.
Well, what are ya waiting for? Talk to her and get it over with.{^n}{^n}The Taken needs to burn.
I'll talk to her now.
Stay back, we've got ourselves a Taken to burn.
What's going on here?
We caught this Taken trying to cast some Aetherial magic. Was probably planning on corrupting the whole area with her wicked Aetherfire.{^n}{^n}So we tied her up and figured we'd give her a little fire of our own. Only sure way to be rid of this taint.
I wish to speak to the Taken first.
I want no part in this.
No time to waste. Burn the Taken!
Ah, look at her fry. It's inspiring, fighting back against the enemy.{^n}{^n}Help yerself to some of her spoils. She was carrying a gemmed dagger. May be worth a few iron bits.
Thanks.
Maybe ya should look her in the eye first.{^n}{^n}Let the terror sink in.
Alright.
I don't want any trouble.
