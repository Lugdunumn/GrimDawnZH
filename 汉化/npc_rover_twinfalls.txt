Be wary, traveler.{^n}{^n}The savages living up in the Four Hills have destroyed this once magnificent structure in an effort to trap their victims.{^n}{^n}With the bridge gone and the road to Smuggler's Pass washed out by storms, the way north is barred to us.
Is there no other way?
There is one other, but you would be a fool to try it.{^n}{^n}South of here, there are ruins of the ancient city of Arkovia. There is a passage there, through the Arkovian Undercity, that leads into the Broken Hills.{^n}{^n}You would be wise to turn back. That is the realm of the cursed dead.
The cursed dead?
Yes, the remnants of Arkovia's cursed people.{^n}{^n}Their tale is a tragic one, but none could tell it better than Amkala, back at our camp near New Harbor.
I will have to speak to her.
Thanks for the warning.
I'll keep that in mind.
Unfortunately I don't have a choice.
I'll be careful.
