All that you've done for us sometimes makes me forget how bad things really are out there.
We'll fix the world, one place at a time.
My husband tells me that the farm is clear of those awful insects. Thank you.
Just trying to help out.
We're just trying to help out.
Please don't start any trouble. We have enough to go around as it is.
Doesn't the Black Legion protect you?
Far as I can see, they're only here because it serves their purposes as a defensible location. They take what they want in the name of their dead emperor, in order to "better serve" us.{^n}{^n}They won't even help us with the Dermapteran infestation. Captain Somer says that they pose no threat. We'll see how much of a threat they pose when we all starve to death because the food ran out.
Sounds awful.
I'll see what I can do.
Goodbye.
